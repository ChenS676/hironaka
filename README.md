# Hironaka

A utility package for reinforcement learning study of Hironaka's game of local resolution of singularities and its variation problems.

For ML and RL specialists, the following two sections should give you an overview:
- [Rule of the game](#rule-of-the-game)
- [The structure of the repo](#the-structure-of-the-repo)

For math-oriented viewers or ML experts who are intrigued about the background story, please feel free to continue with:
- [What is a resolution of singularity](#what-is-a-resolution-of-singularity)
- [What is Hironaka's polyhedral game](#what-is-hironakas-polyhedral-game)
- [Variations of Hironaka's game](#variations-of-hironakas-game)

# Rule of the game
There are two players. To separate the roles, we name them 'host' and 'agent'.

Game state: a set of integral points .......

Host: ......

Agent: ......

......

# The structure of the repo
......

Now the big question is, how is this game related to some fundamental questions in pure math, or specifically, algebraic geometry.
